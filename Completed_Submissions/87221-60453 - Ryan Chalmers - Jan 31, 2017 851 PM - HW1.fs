(* In the template below we have written the names of the functions that
you need to define.  You MUST use these names.  If you introduce auxiliary
functions you can name them as you like, except that your names should not
clash with any of the names we are using.  We have also shown the types
that you should have.  Your code MUST compile and must NOT go into infinite
loops.  An assignment like that means you have not tested it.  You will get
ZERO FOR THE ENTIRE ASSIGMENT even if the problem is only with one
question.  If you are not able to get the code to compile and run do not
submit it.  *)
